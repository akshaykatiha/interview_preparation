#Let's prepare

This readme file is divided in two categories:
- What are be going to learn by June 30, 2022
- Roadmap of how we are going to achieve it

# Learning
1. Programming language **python** and **SQL**
>Why **SQL:** SQL is used in every field, be it testing, development for extraction, transformation, loading of data. So, it is expected that we must have a basic knowledge of SQL. (What we would be learning is discussed later)


2. OOPS concepts and how to use them
>python supports multiple paradigm and OOPS is one of them. So, it is obious that we must know why we should use OOPS in the first place and implementation of it's different properties

3. Algorithm
- We should know how to calculate the complexiy of any program that we write/encounter
- comparison of time complexities i.e. log(n) or nlog(n) which is going to perform better
- famous algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search etc

4. OS
- Why OS? Because many concepts like Multiprocessing and Multithreading, memory utilization comes from OS
- How much OS should be know? Atleast top 50 questions that one may expect from you as a software engineer (just google top 50 questions for OS, no need to practice programming questions of OS)
- Linux commands: basic linux commands are must because 80% of industry uses linux in some way

5. Programming
We must be knowing basic 100-200 programming questions that one would ask. A separate repo is going to contain those programming questions. Add questions there if you think it could be helpful

6. Last but not least **DS**
DS is must. No interviewer is going to ask you programs of DS (until you are not applying for job > 12 LPA), but they can ask you to implement queue or stack. So all concepts of famous DS like array, strings, list, queue is must. Trees, Hasmap, Graph's basic understanding would work

## Python
> From where : EBook like Think Python, website like [programmiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming) and [realpython](https://realpython.com/)

1. Basic python
2. PIP 8
3. String manipulations like indexing
4. String interning
5. String formatting in python
6. Difference between how mutable and immutable objects work
7. init, self, args and kwargs, concept of name == main
8. Iterations and Iterator
9. Local and global namespace
10. Eval, Range, lambda expressions
11. Python is pass by reference or pass by value
12. Packing and Unpacking in python
13. List manipulations : map(), filter() and reduce()
14. ... (will add others items too)

## SQL
> From where : conecpts from W3SCHOOL, questions from SQLZOO

Indexing, Basic commands to extract desired values, Views, Indexing
Concepts like : Normalization, Primary and Foreign Key constraints etc
